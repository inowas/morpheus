  "T09A_title": "Depth of saltwater interface (Ghyben-Herzberg relation)",
  "T09A_description": "The location of the interface between fresh and saltwater can be roughly approximated under static hydraulic conditions (no modflow). By considering the densities of fresh water and sea water, the tool helps to estimate the total thickness of the freshwater lens based on the elevation of groundwater table above sea level.",
  "T09B_title": "Freshwater-saltwater interface (Glover equation)",
  "T09B_description": "Gloverâ€™s equation takes into account the fresh water gradient to approximate the interface between an area of fresh water and an area of sea water and provides some indication of the shape and extent of the interface. In contrast to the Ghyben-Herzberg relation, freshwater discharges into the sea along an area rather than along a line.",
